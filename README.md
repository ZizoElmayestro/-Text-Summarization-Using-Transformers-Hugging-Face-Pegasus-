# -Text-Summarization-Using-Transformers-Hugging-Face-Pegasus-
Code Overview 
This code leverages the Hugging Face transformers library and the Pegasus model, specifically 
f
 ine-tuned on the XSum dataset, to perform abstractive text summarization. The user interacts 
with the code through a graphical interface created with ipywidgets in a Google Colab. 
Key Features 
1. Pretrained Model:  
o Utilizes the Pegasus model from Hugging Face, specifically trained for 
abstractive summarization tasks. 
o Pegasus is known for generating human-like summaries that capture the 
essence of the input text. 
2. Interactive Interface:  
o The interface allows users to input text, generate a summary, and view the result 
using ipywidgets components. 
3. Error Handling:  
o Catches and displays any errors during text processing or summarization. 
Scenario 
This code is best suited for: 
• Academics or Researchers who work in Google Colab and require a simple and 
interactive way to summarize text data. 
• Summarizing Custom Text: Ideal for tasks where the user manually inputs or copies 
large blocks of text for summarization.
